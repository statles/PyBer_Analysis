# PyBer_Analysis
analysis of ride sharing data across cities

# Purpose
THe purpose of this new analysis is to quantify number of drivers, average ride fare, total rides, and other metrics, for three different classes of cities. These classes are: urban, rural, and suburban. The purose of this analysis is to find if there is a significant difference in fares, ridership, and drivers based on city type. This data is then plotted on a line chart for the months of January through April for 2019.

# Results:

As expected, urban cities have the highest ridership and highest total number of drivers. This is because urban cities are more densely populated than rural or suburban cities. Suburban cities have the second highest number of riders and drivers, followed by rural cities. Even though rural cities have the lowest total fare ($4,327 USD), they still have the highest average fare at $34 USD. This may be due to the fact that there are fewer drivers in rural areas, or it may be due to the fact that the average miles for rural trips is longer than for urban rides. In comparing the average fare per rider to the average fare per driver, we see that for suburban and rural cities, the average fare per ride is lower than the average fare per driver. However, for urban ciites, the average fare per ride is higher than the average fare per driver. In addition, there are more drivers than there are total rides for ubran cities, but for rural and suburban cities, there are fewer drivers than there are total rides. This may be due to a shortage in drivers for rural and suburban cities.

# Summary:

Based on the graph, it appears that total fares for suburban cities is increasing compared to rural and suburban cities. This may mean that more drivers need to service suburban areas, since there are more drivers than total rides in urban ciites and less drivers than total rides in suburban cities.
